			<p>I grew up in Overland Park, KS in a tight-knit family whose idea of fun was watching the Chiefs and Royals play and going to high school football games. I’m an extremely family-oriented and goal-driven person. I have a twin brother who helped develop my passion for sports and for people. My weeks were split between going to my own practices and games and watching him play. To me, sports is home and I strive to embody that mindset of “home” in every story I tell and interview I do.

I chose to study broadcast journalism because of the people. I can easily connect with those I meet and tell their stories in ways that encapsulate all that they are. My passion in a lot of ways is listening to others, especially those in the world of athletics, share their passion. Sports broadcasting is a dream job that brings me joy each and every day and I can’t wait to turn it into a full-time career.

I’m currently a senior at the University of Missouri - Columbia and plan to finish my degree in May of 2022. I will graduate with a Bachelor of Journalism with an emphasis in Radio and TV Sports. I’ve worked at the NBC affiliate station, KOMU 8 News for three years as a sports reporter and anchor.

When I’m not telling stories or in the studio, you can find me spending time with friends and family, watching college football, staying active with yoga or the gym, reading, watching any reality TV,and walking my rescue dog, Tito! I cannot wait for the next chapter of my journalism career and I am so thankful for every opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
			<p>I recently accepted a job as the lead sports anchor and reporter at KLKN-TV, the ABC affilliate in Lincoln, Nebraska. I am so excited to get started! <a href="LAURENMICHELSON00@GMAIL.COM">shoot me a message</a>!</p>
